In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, the model suffers from high bias. In this case, both training score and validation score are similar but very low, infact both are below 0.5, so arbitralily worse than simple average. So this is a case where the model is not complex enough to picl up the nuances in the data.\n",
    "- The model is trained with a maximum depth of 10, the model suffers from high variance. In this case, training score is very high and testing score is low. Thus the model is overfitting to the training data and by-hearting it and cannot generalize well."

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

The performance for each hyperparameter set is calculated on cross-validation training.\n",

    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that.

    "**Answer:** K-fold cross validation:\n",
    "- Dataset is devided into k subsets of equal size\n",
    "- K iterations of traning & testing are run, where in each iteration a new subset is kept as the testing set and the remaining k-1 subsets form the training set. So, each subset acts as the testing set 1 time, and acts as the training set K-1 times.\n",
    "- Average testing performance is used as the estimate of out-of-sample(forecasting for an observation that was not part of the training sample) performance, also known as cross-validated performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits in grid search:\n",
    "- Evaluating different hyperparameters for a model can still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally. \n",
    "    - This way, knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model. \n",
    "    - This can be solved by partioning data into 3 sets: training set, validation set and test set. After doing all training and testing on the training set and validation sets respectively, final evaluation can be done on test set which wasn't touched before this. \n",
    "    - However, partitioning the data into three sets drastically reduces the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the results can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets.\n",
    "- Cross-validation solves this as a test set is still held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV.\n",
    "- CV can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data, as the training set is fully utilized for training without overfitting on it by training and validating on a different slice of the training data in each iteration and averaging the results."

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
